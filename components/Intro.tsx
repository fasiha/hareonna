        I had often opened the Wikipedia page for various cities and inspected
        the table of monthly temperature lows and highs to get a sense of what
        the climate was like. This app is a generalization of that.
      </p>
      <p>
        The details are on{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/fasiha/hareonna/">GitHub</a> but in a
        nutshell, I grabbed all ~13'500 global weather stations that had
        temperature data over the last three years and looked at the temperature{" "}
        <em>percentile</em>s. I think percentiles are a more compact set of
        numbers to understand compared to the monthly averages Wikipedia has:
        the table below will have the specifics but a 50-percentile low means
        that half the days in the last three years were less than that value. A
        10-percentile low means ~5 weeks of a year have lows lower than this,
        and a 90-percentile low means ~5 weeks per year have lows{" "}
        <em>higher</em> than this.
      </p>
      <p>
        So something I enjoy doing is,
        <ol>
          <li>
            first select a weather station near my home (you can either search
            OpenStreetMap or just zoom around the map) and clicking{" "}
            <button>Pick</button>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then find some <em>other</em> faraway place and click{" "}
            <button>Find similar</button>.
          </li>
        </ol>
        That should get you started! And sorry, as you can tell from the buttons
        and the widgets and the cobbled-together nature of everything, this was
        thrown together in literally a weekend, but I hope you like it!
